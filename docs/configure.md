# Configure

All configurations are located in `~/.SetupUserConfig`.  
Open the configuration folder running `open ~/.SetupUserConfig`.

If that folder does not exists, run `~/.setup/Configure.sh` which will generate the `SetupUserConfig` folder and go through the configuration with you.

`Configure.sh` can always be ran if the `SetupUserConfig` folder already exists, then it will simply go through the configuration with you without overwriting your current `SetupUserConfig`.

If you wish to overwrite your `SetupUserConfig` folder, then first run `rm -rf ~/.SetupUserConfig` or `clear-setup-config`.
